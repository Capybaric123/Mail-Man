This is a simple style io game where you are a ofice worker in the 90's and your goal is to send emails which are going to be requested from you by your boss.

This game is made using:

- **[HTML](https://html.com/)** for the actual page and UI
- **[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)** for the styling so the website doesn't look like it's strait from the 2009
- **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)** for the actual code of the web page so it's not just a dummy page (a static page)

## About Me

I am a newbie to all of the web development since I started learning **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** as my first language and then switched to **[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))**, this means that the actual game may have a lot of bugs and issues, but don't be shy to report them since I am trying my best to make this game better and more entertaining, this means I will need support from who is testing the game right now. The feedback will be very usefull for me rightnow since I am just starting this project and web dev at all.

## Issuetracking

If you want to help with the development of this game you can always use [this link](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Mail-Man/issues) to open the issues tab and also report a bug. This would be very usefull especially while the software is still in development what means there is a lot of different bugs and issues which are not helping the game in any way! So, if you see a bug or want me to try to add something you can always try out the issues page, I mean it exists for something at least, so don't be shy to report bugs you have found and help the developer by giving me feedback from your game expirience what will lead to game improvement and growth, and if the game does well with the issues maybe I will continue on the development since right now me and my team are working on an even bigger project called Stickman-Stories, where I am the team leader, so if you feel bored of playing this game you can always go and check out my ne webcomic **[Stickman-Stories](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/)**
