This is a simple simulator about mining.
In this game your goal is to get the most money possible.
The code is writen in javascript, but the project itself is built around html5 and css.
I am new to javascript so if you find any issues you can always report them in the similarly named tab in the repo.
This project is one of many of my other old projects which I dropped but I will keep working on this one until I am satisfied.
There are github pages set-up for the project so I'll be happy if you go and check out what the game actually looks like.

Here is the link to the site: https://capybaric123.github.io/Mining-Simulator/

Here is an example of the UI in the game:
